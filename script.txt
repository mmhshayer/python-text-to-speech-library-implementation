google has announced that its world-leading search bar will now feature a generative artificial intelligence (AI) if you live in the United States. Called "Google Search Generative Experience," or SGE for short, rollouts for it began on the morning of May 25. Not only that, but Google Search users will also get access to Google's "Search Labs" too. But you'll need to sign up for a waiting list to be one of the first users of the new services.
Recently unveiled at Google I/O 2023, Google SGE is an innovative integration of conversational AI into the traditional search experience. If you've ever used Bing AI, you'll find that Google's product is familiar, but it does have its own unique properties too.
According to a preview on Engadget, Google's AI-powered search still utilizes the same input bar as before, rather than a separate chatbot field like Bing. However, the generative AI results now appear in a shaded section beneath the search bar (but above sponsored results) and above the standard web results. A button on the top right of the AI results allows users to expand the snapshot, adding cards that display sourced articles. Also, users can ask follow-up questions by simply tapping a button below the results.
